KeepInTouch is a web application designed for teachers and students in a high school setting. It is a social network that
allows students to contact teachers outside of available class and office hours, as well as check the class calendar, view
the list of assignments, and make public postings to others.

It also features a log-in system with authentication that provides different features depending on whether you are a 
student or teacher. 2 Users are hard-coded in, and are specified below.

It is implemented through HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript, and is hosted on the University of Evansville CSSERVER.
