// This repository contains project 2 for CS 350 for Spring 2018.

This is an alternate implementation or Project1, this time using Microsoft WPF.
It is meant for two applications to be run simultaneously in the same local directory.
One applications posts messages, and the other views them.

It is recommended that you make an empty folder that you can locate easily to store message files. This folder will be used for both applications to read and write messages, and can be selected during run time. 

In order to run this application you will need Windows 10 and Visual Studio 2015 or later.

The entire project has too many supporting files to be included on Github, only the parts
I programmed are included.

This project is implemented through C#.
